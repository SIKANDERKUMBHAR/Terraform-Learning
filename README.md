## Introduction

Terraform is an open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It allows you to define your infrastructure as code, enabling you to automate the provisioning and management of cloud resources.

## Initialization and Setup

### `terraform init`

The `terraform init` command initializes a Terraform working directory by creating initial files and downloading the necessary provider plugins.

```sh
terraform init
```

## Configuration and Planning

### `terraform plan`

The `terraform plan` command generates an execution plan showing the changes that will be made to the infrastructure based on the current configuration and the existing state.

```sh
terraform plan
```

### `terraform validate`

The `terraform validate` command checks whether the configuration files in the directory are syntactically correct.

```sh
terraform validate
```

## Applying and Destroying Infrastructure

### `terraform apply`

The `terraform apply` command applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration. This command will prompt for confirmation before making any changes unless the `-auto-approve` flag is used.

```sh
terraform apply
```

### `terraform destroy`

The `terraform destroy` command destroys the Terraform-managed infrastructure. This command will prompt for confirmation before destroying any resources unless the `-auto-approve` flag is used.

```sh
terraform destroy
```

## State Management

### `terraform state list`

The `terraform state list` command lists all the resources in the current state file.

```sh
terraform state list
```

### `terraform state show [RESOURCE]`

The `terraform state show` command shows the attributes of a single resource in the state file.

```sh
terraform state show [RESOURCE]
```

## Resource Targeting

### `terraform taint [RESOURCE]`

The `terraform taint` command marks a resource for recreation during the next `terraform apply`.

```sh
terraform taint [RESOURCE]
```

### `terraform untaint [RESOURCE]`

The `terraform untaint` command removes the tainted state from a resource.

```sh
terraform untaint [RESOURCE]
```

## Working with Modules

### `terraform get`

The `terraform get` command downloads and installs modules for the configuration.

```sh
terraform get
```

### `terraform module list`

The `terraform module list` command lists all the modules used in the current configuration.

```sh
terraform module list
```

## Miscellaneous Commands

### `terraform output`

The `terraform output` command displays the values of output variables defined in the configuration.

```sh
terraform output
```

### `terraform fmt`

The `terraform fmt` command formats the configuration files to a canonical format and style.

```sh
terraform fmt
```

### `terraform version`

The `terraform version` command displays the current version of Terraform.

```sh
terraform version
```

## Conclusion

This guide covers the basic commands to get you started with Terraform. For more detailed information, refer to the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html).

Happy Terraforming!
